tetris:
  watches for change in value of playerX/online property
  on change, if snapshot is null and we're watching, then try to join
  join function is passed a playernum
  tries to set playerX/online to true
  if successful, that player has joined and the game starts


I need to:

  have a /players/playerX/online property

  watch /players for changes
    if both are set, start game

  have a /game/board property
    after each move, set it to the current board

  have a /game/turn property
  have a /game/round property
  watch /game/board for changes
    on change, redraw the entire board
    on change, increment round
    on change, change turn


user visits page
click tic tac toe, see the two buttons
they click play against human
they're prompted for name
they wait for another player
another player joins, enters name
game begins
each player moves in turn until the game is over
players see a button to play again - if they click, repeat original join process



user clicks play against human
at this point, ttt index fires humanGame function
calls startGame, passing in false for gregbot
startGame instantiates board and view, then renders it


I need:
user clicks tic tac toe button
waitToJoin function is called
this function sets up watc
user clicks play against human
ttt index fires tryToJoin function
this function sets players/player0 or players/player1 to their name
have a function watching both player0 and player1
